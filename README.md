# Stand_alone_positioning
Running the code.m file estimates the precise location of a user receiver from raw GPS data.

The codes read a single-epoch data set to compute user location with least squares iteration.

User position can be improved by further modelling the troposphere and applying ionospheric corrections.
Also, further asnalysis can be done to create a scenario where satellites with high clock offsets and residuals are ommitted from data processing.
